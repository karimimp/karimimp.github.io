## CFD Modeling of Hydrocyclone
---

The modeling of hydrocyclone was the first research project that I worked on. During my master thesis I modeled the separation behavior of this device through experiments, analytical models and CFD. The **Response Surface Method** of **DOE** was applied to optimized effective parameters on the separation efficiency. The video below shows the flow pattern in a transparent lab-scale hydrocyclone that I designed and manufactured during my work.

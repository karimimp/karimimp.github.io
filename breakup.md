## Breakup Models Developments for Gas-Liquid and Liquid-Liquid Systems
---

I worked for 2 years on developing fundamental models for improving the understanding of droplet and gas bubble breakup in turbulent flows. The idea was to improve the breakup kernels for population balance equation to account for the entire turbulent energy spectrum via simulations and experimental validations.
